Description=Persistent wineserver shared by multiple wine-based services
# wine automatically starts and stops wineserver as needed. the first wine
# instance spawns the server and the last closed instance reaps it.
# unfortunately, that does not work with wine instances in systemd services.
# the wineserver will be part of the service that was started first and will
# be forcibly terminated when that service is stopped. all other services that
# use wine will be left without a wineserver, breaking these services.
# this service runs wineserver as a separate systemd service that all
# wine-based services should depend on (After= and Requires=).

# start after sway set environment variables (DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY)
After=sway.service
Requires=sway.service

# stop wineserver when last dependent unit stopped
